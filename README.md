👋 Hey, I’m Emel

I’m currently working on university projects and several side apps that help me grow in C/C++, Kotlin, web development, and backend engineering. This semester, I’m diving deeper into Database Systems, Software Testing, Project Management, and Programming Languages, and I’m excited to apply everything I learn as I move toward real-world development experience.

🔍 Some Highlights:

 -Database Systems – working with SQL, NoSQL, and exploring different database engines

 -Software Verification, Validation & Testing – learning how testing actually keeps software stable and maintainable

 -Software Project Management – understanding how to plan, track, and deliver software (not just code it)

 -Programming Languages – studying how languages work under the hood and where each one shines
